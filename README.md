# Minecraft Logic Gate Simulator

Python code to simulate basic logic gates in Minecraft: Pi Edition

minecraft-logic-AND.py is the first version of the simulation that uses 3 blocks to represent an AND gate - 2 blocks for the inputs and 1 for the output, using stone for off and gold for on.

minecraft-logic-4_Blocks.py is the second version that adds in a fourth block to represent the different gates.

minecraft-logic.py is the final version that adds in water and lava to represent whether there is electricity flowing in the wires.
